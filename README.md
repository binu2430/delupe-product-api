# Laravel Product API

This is a Laravel-based API that imports products from a `products.json` file, stores them in a PostgreSQL database, adjusts product prices dynamically, and outputs the updated product list as JSON.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd laravel-product-api
